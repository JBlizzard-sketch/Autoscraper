🎉 UUID Migration Complete!
I've successfully fixed all the critical UUID type mismatches in your AutoParts Kenya platform. Here's what was accomplished:

✅ What Was Fixed
1. Storage Interface (IStorage)

Changed all cart/order ID parameters from number to string (UUID)
Updated 15+ method signatures for cart and order operations
Ensured type consistency across the entire storage layer
2. Memory Storage Implementation

Replaced auto-increment counters with crypto.randomUUID() for:
Cart IDs
Cart Item IDs
Order IDs
Order Item IDs
Blog Post IDs
Blog Category IDs
Added missing fields to Order (delivery_county, delivery_town, whatsapp_message_id)
Added missing field to OrderItem (product_sku)
3. Routes Verification

Confirmed cart/order routes already handle UUID strings correctly
No Number() coercion on UUID parameters (already using req.params.id as strings)
4. Code Quality

✅ 0 LSP errors - All type issues resolved
✅ Architect-reviewed - Code changes approved
✅ Dual-mode architecture working - Both MemoryStorage and PostgresStorage support UUIDs
🚀 Current Status
Working:

Application running on port 5000 ✅
Homepage loading correctly ✅
Cart API returning UUIDs (e.g., "1ad4d263-ce33-4451-8860-f04cc7117d1a") ✅
All API endpoints functional ✅
101 products loaded from CSV ✅
Cart API Endpoints Ready:

GET /api/cart - Get/create cart for session
POST /api/cart/items - Add item to cart
PATCH /api/cart/items/:id - Update quantity
DELETE /api/cart/items/:id - Remove item
DELETE /api/cart - Clear cart
📋 Next Steps (For Future Agent)
The backend is fully ready, but the cart frontend components still need to be built:

CartContext - Global cart state management
CartButton - Header cart icon with item count badge
CartDrawer - Slide-out cart panel
CartItem - Individual cart item component with quantity controls
See AGENT_ROADMAP.md Task 2.3 for detailed implementation guidance.

📚 Documentation Updated
✅ AGENT_ROADMAP.md - Agent 2 marked as partially complete with clear handoff notes
✅ replit.md - Added "Recent Changes" section documenting UUID migration
Your e-commerce platform now has a solid, production-ready foundation with proper UUID support throughout the cart and order system! 🎊
