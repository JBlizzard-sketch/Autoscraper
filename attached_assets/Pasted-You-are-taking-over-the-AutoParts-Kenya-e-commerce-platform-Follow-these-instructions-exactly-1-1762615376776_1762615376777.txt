You are taking over the AutoParts Kenya e-commerce platform. Follow these instructions exactly:

1. **Review handoff.md first** for all remaining tasks and context.

2. **Database context**:
   - Tables `brands`, `categories`, `subcategories` are already imported.
   - Only `products` and `product_images` need importing.
   - Ignore fixed SQL schemas for these two tables; instead, **adapt the database schema dynamically** to match the uploaded CSV headers.

3. **CSV files**: I will provide the CSV contents in the prompt for:
   - `products.csv`
   - `product_images.csv`
   - (brands, categories, subcategories already imported, no need)

4. **Dynamic schema adaptation**:
   - Detect headers in each CSV.
   - Add missing columns or adjust types (`TEXT`, `NUMERIC`, `TIMESTAMP`) to match the CSV.
   - Do not delete or overwrite existing tables/data.

5. **Seeding and normalization**:
   - Seed initial ~100 products and their images from the CSVs.
   - Normalize all fields:
       - Trim whitespace
       - `INITCAP` for names
       - URL-friendly slugs from product names
       - Lowercase URLs
   - Ensure foreign key integrity:
       - Only insert products if `brand_id` and `subcategory_id` exist
       - Only insert images if `product_id` exists
   - Idempotent: safe to re-run when uploading full CSVs later.

6. **Verification**:
   - Products: ~100 entries, correct slugs, normalized names, valid FK references.
   - Product images: linked `product_id` exists, URLs normalized.
   - Future CSV imports should append without conflicts.

7. **Repository / Documentation updates**:
   - Add CSVs to the repo.
   - Update `handoff.md` with:
       - Dynamic schema adaptation instructions
       - Seeding instructions for `products` and `product_images`
       - Normalization and slug rules
       - Verification steps

8. **Continue remaining handoff tasks**:
   - Frontend integration (React → API)
   - WhatsApp checkout
   - Vehicle-specific filters
   - Category navigation, pagination, image gallery
   - SEO, performance, analytics, monitoring

**Goal**: After running this, the database has normalized `products` and `product_images`, ready for future CSV syncs, and all remaining `handoff.md` tasks can proceed immediately.
