New spark plugs, for instance, keep your engine at its peak and efficiency levels.Benefits of replacing spark plugsThe primary benefit is knowing your car will start without a hitch. Needless to say, thatâs not all that matters. New spark plugs provide a lot of other performance benefits as well.1.Firstly, consistent production of optimal combustion. Fully functioning spark plugs equate a fully functioning combustion system. Get this operating successfully, and a lot of performance issues youâre experiencing could be a distant memory.2. Secondly, better fuel economy. The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence says misfiring spark plugs can reduce fuel efficiency by 30%. New plugs, when replaced at specified intervals, maximize fuel economy and save some dough.3. Thirdly, smooth and energetic starts. The first time you turn the ignition with a new spark plug can be an eye-opening experience. That old spark plug may have been the reason your car was experiencing those jerky starts.4. Fourth, less harmful emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency states that regular engine tune-upsâespecially in regard to spark plugsânot only save gas but also reduce air pollution. Thatâs a win-win.5. Lastly, reduces the risk of catalytic converter failure.Polish Venture says NO to COUNTERFEIT!80% of spark plugs sold in Kenya today are counterfeit.
